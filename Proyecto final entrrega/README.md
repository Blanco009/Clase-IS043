Arquitectura del computador, Final Proyect.

************************************************************************************************************************************************
A web page was created that allows users to add, edit and delete personal notes which can be personalized.

Each note will have an assigned color (green, yellow or red) and will be
stored locally in (localStorage) so that users can access them on future visits.

A form was implemented that allows users to enter new notes.
Also included are fields for the content of the note, the selection of a color (green, yellow or red) and
buttons to save, edit, delete and delete.

Likewise, when you inspect the page you can see the information of each text, such as its note, color and the time in which it was saved and if the note was edited or deleted and it will be registered in the localStorage and you can see in the console and application option.

The JavaScript localStorage object was used to store the notes persistently in the browser and when the user reloads the page, everything previously saved is reloaded and kept on the page.
